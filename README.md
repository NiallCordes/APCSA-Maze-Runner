# APCSA-Maze-Runner
This project is a demonstration of our learning from Unit 8 on 2D Arrays to create a Maze Runner.
Throughout this process, my code for Parts 1 and 2 got deleted since Ethan uploaded his code to Github right after I uploaded my things, so he wasn't able to pull in time and my code got erased.
A part we struggled with was communication since we weren't able to find each other's Zoom passwords to log on with each other after with Zoom's new update.
